OList, an e-commerce company, has been facing losses recently and aims to optimize inventory management to reduce unnecessary costs. This project focuses on managing inventory costs by identifying top revenue-generating products and using Market Basket Analysis to understand customer purchase behavior. These insights will help improve inventory management, reduce holding costs, and optimize the stocking of high-demand products and complementary items.
